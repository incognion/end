**Definition and Scope of Bio-Ceramic Materials:**

Any substance that interacts with the biological system and is used for medical or clinical applications is referred to as biomaterials. Among these, bio-ceramics, bio-polymers, bio-composites, and bio-metals play a significant role. Current research efforts are focused on successfully applying biomaterials in various biomedical and medical contexts, especially the use of bio-ceramics in medical, dental, and orthopedic fields. The applications of bio-ceramics have significantly increased in the past decades, contributing to the improvement of the quality of human life.

**Bioceramics:**
Bioceramics refer to the design and fabrication of ceramics used for the repair and reconstruction of diseased, damaged, or worn-out parts of the body. The ceramics employed for these purposes are known as bio-ceramics.

**Preparation of Bio-ceramics and Characterization of Bioactivity**

The bioactive glass 45S5 (Hench glass), with a composition of 45% SiO2, 24.5% Na2O, 24.5% CaO, and 6% P2O5 (wt%), was prepared by substituting Li2O, K2O, ZnO, MgO, B2O3, and other oxides using the conventional melting process in an electric globar furnace at 1400±10°C. Controlled crystallization was carried out to convert the bio glasses into their corresponding bio glass ceramics.

The bioactivity of the prepared glass and glass ceramics was tested using FTIR reflection spectrometry, XRD, and SEM before and after immersion in simulated body fluid for different periods at 37°C with a pH of 7.4.

**Bio Glass Preparation**

The bioactive glass 45S5 (Hench glass) was prepared by substituting Li2O, K2O, ZnO, MgO, and B2O3. For the preparation of 100 grams of bioactive glass, fine-grained quartz served as the silica source, and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), calcium carbonate (CaCO3), ammonium dihydrogen orthophosphate (NH4H2PO4), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), boric acid (H3BO3), potassium carbonate (K2CO3), zinc oxide (ZnO), and magnesium carbonate (MgCO3) were used as sources of sodium oxide (Na2O), calcium oxide (CaO), phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), boron trioxide (B2O3), potassium oxide (K2O), zinc oxide (ZnO), and magnesium oxide (MgO), respectively.

Bioactive glasses were prepared using the conventional method. Materials were weighed using an electronic balance, mixed homogeneously with an agate pestle mortar, and melted in platinum crucibles at 1400±10°C for 4 hours in a globar furnace. After melting, the glass was poured onto a steel sheet, cooled to room temperature, crushed, and remelted for an additional two hours to ensure homogeneity. The glass was then poured onto a hot rectangular mold on a steel sheet, annealed at 480°C to remove thermal stresses, and cooled to room temperature with a controlled rate of cooling. Annealed glass samples were preserved for bioactivity and surface behavior analysis using XRD, FTIR, and SEM spectrometry.

**Preparation of Glass to Glass Ceramic Samples (Heat Treatment Process)**

The bio glass samples underwent a two-step thermal heating regime at deduced temperatures. Each bio glass sample was slowly heated to the first nucleation temperature to form sufficient nuclei sites. After holding for 4 hours, it was further heated to reach the second chosen crystal growth temperature for perfect crystal growth. After a second hold for 6 hours, the specimen was left to cool inside the muffle furnace to room temperature at a rate of 20°C per hour.

**Characterization Features of Bio Ceramics (Glass & Glass Ceramics)**

1. **Chemical Composition:**
   The chemical composition of 45S5 Glass is 45% SiO2, 24.5% Na2O, 24.5% CaO, and 6% P2O5, all in wt%. Silica (SiO2) is a primary compositional variable affecting the rate of bonding and bioactivity. In animal experiments, it was observed that if silica varies from 40-45%, the implant bonds to bone and soft tissue. Na2O and CaO content variations have little effect on bioactivity, and P2O5 content varies from 2-6 wt%, influencing bioactivity. Additional compositions like Al2O3, ZrO2, and TiO2 (2-3%) can replace 45% SiO2 to 42% SiO2 to assess implant bioactivity.

2. **Size and Shape of Solid:**
   Raw materials (oxide constituents) are mixed, melted in a platinum crucible, poured into a steel mold, and shaped according to the size and form needed for specific diseases and damaged body parts.

**Bioactive Composite Materials: Ceramic-Metal Matrix Composite and Polymer Composite**

The development of bioceramics has been driven by the consideration of bioactivity. It was realized through extensive research that ceramics alone, whether bioactive or inert, could not fulfill the diverse requirements for safe and effective in vivo functioning. In response, new research focused on composite materials, leveraging the desirable properties of each constituent material while mitigating the limitations of individual components.

Bioceramic composites are categorized into three types: bio-inert, bio-active, and bio-degradable, with ceramics often used as the reinforced material. The properties of these composites vary based on their classification:

1. **Bio-Inert:**
   - Minimal biological response
   - Higher wear resistance
   - Examples: Carbon fiber-reinforced carbon, carbon fiber-reinforced bone cement, carbon fiber-poly matrix material

2. **Bio-Active:**
   - Enhanced bone tissue response
   - Bone bonding
   - Examples: Zirconia reinforced with A/W glass ceramics, titanium fiber-reinforced bioactive glass, calcium phosphate particle-reinforced polyethylene, calcium phosphate particle-reinforced bone cement

3. **Resorbable:**
   - Material replacement by normal tissue
   - Limited long-term effects
   - Examples: Calcium phosphate fiber-reinforced polylactic acid

To address the limitations of bio-ceramics, composites have been developed to overcome problems. Examples of bio-ceramic composites include:

- **Inert Composite Materials:**
  - Carbon fiber-reinforced carbon
  - Carbon fiber-reinforced bone cement
  - Carbon fiber-poly matrix material

- **Bioactive Composite Materials:**
  - Zirconia reinforced with A/W glass ceramics
  - Titanium fiber-reinforced bioactive glass
  - Calcium phosphate particle-reinforced polyethylene
  - Calcium phosphate particle-reinforced bone cement

These bio-composite materials maintain bioactivity while enhancing fracture toughness and strength compared to ceramic materials alone.

**Bioactive Polymer Composite Materials:**

Bioactive hydroxyapatite-polymer composites are utilized as implants to mimic hard tissue repair. For instance, hydroxyapatite-reinforced polyethylene composites exhibit suitable mechanical strength and compatibility with enhanced bioactivity. Researchers have observed that increasing the volume fraction of hydroxyapatite particulates improves Young's modulus, making it suitable for orthopedic materials, ensuring a stable implant-tissue interface during physiological testing.

The fracture characteristics of the composite depend on the volume fraction of hydroxyapatite. Achieving a balance in the composition is crucial to attaining a combination of Young's modulus with fracture characteristics (ductile or brittle). For bone substitution, a volume fraction of 0.4 of hydroxyapatite has been clinically used in reconstructing bone.

Hydroxyapatite has also been reinforced with polymethyl methacrylate bone cement, presenting challenges due to the brittle nature of the matrix material. An alternative material, polyethyl methacrylate bone cement, with increased ductility, aims to improve stiffening and strengthening with hydroxyapatite. To achieve appropriate mechanical properties, the distribution of hydroxyapatite, particle size, particle size distribution, and surface area are critical considerations.

Among various bio-ceramic-polymer combinations, the HA-polyethylene polymer composite demonstrates superior mechanical properties and biological behavior, showcasing significant potential.

**Stainless Steel Fiber/Bioactive Glass Composite:**

The composition of the bioactive glass is 45% SiO2, 24.5% CaO, 24.5% Na2O, and 6% P2O5, while stainless steel includes 16-20% Cr, 10-14% Ni, 2-4% Mo, and 0.003% C. The preparation of the stainless steel fiber/bioactive glass composite involves several steps:

1. Preparing the fiber preform and compacting it using hot isostatic pressing.
2. Sintering the fiber at 1250°C.
3. Oxidizing the surface of the sintered metal fiber preform at 800°C for 10 minutes.
4. Controlling the total metal shrinkage by holding the porous preform at 400°C for 20 minutes.
5. Immersing the preform into molten glass at 1450°C.
6. Annealing the glass-impregnated preform at 575°C for 4 hours and furnace cooling it to room temperature.

The main advantage of inorganic scaffolds made of hydroxyapatite (HA), bioactive glass, or other bioceramics is their high biocompatibility. However, they suffer from low mechanical strength and high brittleness. One approach being investigated to improve the mechanical properties of these brittle scaffolds is to coat them with polymer layers. This aims to fill existing cracks in the bioceramic structure with a polymer phase. The hypothesis is that polymer filaments will bridge cracks during fracture, thus increasing the scaffold toughness, similar to how collagen fibers enhance the fracture toughness of bone.

This approach has been extended to include scaffolds with interpenetrating network structures. In this case, the polymer is added not only as a surface coating but is also made to penetrate and infiltrate the pore walls (struts) of the scaffold via remaining porosity or microcracks. Additionally, the polymer phase can have other functions, such as being a carrier for drugs and other biomolecules (e.g., growth factors), enhancing the functionality and bioactivity of the scaffolds.

In this paper, we review the relevant previous work in the field of polymer-coated inorganic scaffolds and scaffolds with interpenetrating network microstructures. The review is organized as follows: the section "Fabrication of Inorganic Scaffolds" includes a description of three typical fabrication technologies developed for the production of bioceramic scaffolds. The section "Bio-ceramic Scaffolds Combined with Polymers" contains a detailed analysis of the available literature on polymer-coated and interpenetrating microstructure systems. The section "Recent Developments: Bioactive Glass–Ceramic/PDLLA Composite Scaffolds with Interpenetrating Microstructure" presents recent results on a BioglassÒ/poly(D,L-lactide)(PDLLA) composite system, as an example of a novel scaffold with interpenetrating network structure.

**Fabrication of Inorganic Scaffolds:**
This section briefly reviews three methods widely used for the fabrication of inorganic scaffolds. A more detailed description of these and other scaffold technologies, including computer-assisted methods (e.g., rapid prototyping), has been presented elsewhere. One of the methods is the Foam Replication Method.

**Foam Replication Method:**
The earliest production of macroporous ceramics by the foam replica method dates back to the early 1960s. Schwartzwalder and Somers used polymeric sponges as templates to prepare ceramic cellular structures of various pore sizes, porosities, and chemical compositions. In this method, synthetic (e.g., polymer foams, typically polyurethane, PU) and natural (e.g., coral, wood) templates with the desired macrostructure can be used to fabricate macroporous ceramics.

The template is initially soaked into a ceramic suspension until it is homogeneously coated with the ceramic material. The coating should be viscous enough to avoid dripping by thixotropic effects. Thickening additives, such as clays, colloidal silica, carboxymethyl cellulose, and polyethylene oxide in combination with conventional dispersants, can be used. Moreover, binders and plasticizers are added to the initial suspension to prevent cracking of the struts during the subsequent heat-treatment process.

The ceramic-coated polymeric template is subsequently dried, and the polymer template is burned out through careful heating between 300 and 800 °C. Finally, it is densified by sintering in an appropriate atmosphere at temperatures between 1,000 to 1,500 °C, depending on the material. This method can produce highly porous ceramics with open and interconnected porosity levels in the range of 40–95%, and sizes of pores between 200 μm and 3 mm.

One possible disadvantage of the method is the tendency to produce a hole in the center of each strut, resulting from the removal of the polymer skeleton on heating. The presence of this hole can negatively affect the mechanical properties of the foams. However, the approach of filling the hole with a polymer, as discussed below, leads to improved mechanical behavior by exploiting.

**A/W Glass Ceramics: Processing and Properties**

Glass is converted to glass ceramics through a heat treatment process, resulting in glass ceramics with superior properties compared to glass. A/W glass, composed of 3CaO.P2O5 (apatite), CaO.SiO2 (wollastonite), MgO.CaO.SiO2, CaF2, and other components for improved properties, has apatite (calcium phosphate) and wollastonite (calcium silicate) as its main compositions.

**Step 1: Melting and Solidification**
1. Melt the A/W glass composition (CaO 44.7, SiO2 34.0, MgO 4.6, P2O5 6.2) using conventional melting in a glass melting furnace at 1450°C. 
2. Maintain a heating rate of 5°C/min.
3. After melting, pour the glass into a steel mold for solidification.
4. Quench the solidified melt glass to obtain fine glass powder with a size of 5 micrometers.
5. Press the powder into the desired form or shape using a hydraulic press (A/W glass).

**Step 2: Crystallization**
1. Heat the desired-shaped glass to 1050°C at a rate of 5°C/min.
2. Convert it to glass ceramics (A/W glass ceramics) through crystallization.
3. After heat treatment, eliminate cracks, but some microspores remain in the intergranular space of the glass powder due to the precipitation of apatite and wollastonite before densification.
4. Add a small amount (0.5 percent) of CaF2 for fully densification and heat treatment at 830°C.
5. Oxyfluoroapatite and wollastonite successfully precipitate, providing pore-free high density and homogeneous A/W glass ceramics.

**Properties of A/W Glass Ceramics:**
- Density: 3.07 g/cm³
- Bending Strength: 215 MPa
- Compressive Strength: 180 MPa
- Young's Modulus: 118 GPa
- Vickers Hardness: 680
- Fracture Toughness: 2.0 MPa√m

Apatite-wollastonite (A/W) glass ceramics exhibit a strong binding capability to living bone. Over the last four decades, A/W glass ceramics have been used in spine and hip surgery for patients with bone and joint defects, with satisfactory results in many applications.

The initial trial involved bonding A/W glass ceramics to rabbit bones. After implantation, the bioactivity (bonding ability) was evaluated, and the results were satisfactory in rabbit bones. Subsequently, the application was extended to human trials.

Before implantation, various properties need testing, including compressive strength, friction, wear resistance, bending strength, elastic modulus, bioactivity, biocompatibility, and other characterizations such as chemical composition, particle size, shape, surface characteristics, phase analysis, microstructure, and surface behavior.

After extensive analysis and research, it was found that A/W glass ceramics exhibit superior bioactivity, bonding to bones compared to dense hydroxyapatite (HA) after 25 weeks of implantation.

**Applications:**
- Load Bearing Capacity: 70%, which is close to human bone.
- Research indicates that A/W glass ceramics directly bond to bone tissues.
- A/W glass ceramic implants are used for load-bearing prostheses.
- A/W glass ceramics serve as bone defect fillers.

**Discussion of Phosphate (CaP) Ceramics:**

The calcium phosphate implant is composed of the same ions as the minerals found in natural bone. Its chemical formula is Ca3(PO4)6, closely resembling Hydroxyapatite (HA) (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2), both appearing in a single structural state. The synthetic form of CaP has demonstrated chemical and crystallographic similarity to naturally occurring HA, making it suitable as a bone graft substitution.

Calcium phosphate materials have garnered significant research attention due to their chemical resemblance to bones and teeth. They are attractive biomedical materials owing to their excellent biocompatibility and the non-toxic nature of their chemical components.

These materials exhibit positive interactions with living tissue, including the differentiation of immature cells into bone cells. There is also chemical bonding to the bone along the interface, believed to be triggered by the adsorption of bone growth-mediating proteins at the biomaterial's surface. This biochemical mediation leads to strong new bone formation, including compressive, tensile, and shear forces transmitted through the interface ("bony ingrowth").

While the properties of calcium phosphate ceramics resemble hard tissue, their use in load-bearing applications is limited due to low strength. To address this, metal alloy coatings are applied to improve the bonding strength for orthopedic applications.

The use of calcium phosphate materials dates back to the 1920s when they were employed as bone substitutes or grafts. In 1971, researchers proposed the use of calcium-fluorapatite ceramics for dental and medical implant materials.

**Processing of CaP Bio-Ceramics:**

Calcium phosphate bio-ceramics are synthesized using the chemical precipitation method. An aqueous solution of calcium nitrate and di-ammonium phosphate undergoes precipitation at 800°C. The resulting Ca-P powder, with low density, is then sintered at over 1050°C to achieve high-density (99 percent) CaP bio-ceramics.

**Properties of CaP Bio-Ceramics:**

- Physical properties: Density (3.15 g/cm³)
- Mechanical properties: Compressive strength (100-900 MPa), Bending strength (20-80 MPa), Fracture toughness (MPa1/2), Hardness (500-800), Young's modulus (70-120 GPa)

The prepared CaP bio-ceramics are immersed in simulated body fluid (SBF) for varying time periods (1, 3, 7, 15, and 30 days). Afterward, the CaP bio-ceramics are tested for hydroxy carbonate apatite (HCA) formation over time. HCA formation is confirmed through XRD, FTIR, and SEM-EDS analysis after SBF treatment, verifying the bioactivity of the bio-ceramic material.

1. **Tissue Engineering Scaffolds:**
   - Utilized as scaffolds in tissue engineering for the regeneration of bone or dentin.

2. **Injectable Cements and Coatings on Implants:**
   - Applied in injectable cements or as coatings on titanium and titanium alloy implants. This combination harnesses the bioactivity of calcium phosphates and the strength of metals.

3. **Various Dental Applications:**
   - Repair of periodontal defects.
   - Augmentation of alveolar bone.
   - Sinus lifts.
   - Tooth replacement.
   - Repair of large bone defects caused by tumors.

**Alumina Used in Surgical Implants:**

Alumina ceramics have seen significant use in surgical implants over the past decades, contributing to the advancement of medical ceramics. The utilization of bioceramics has grown considerably for applications involving living tissue.

**Characteristics of Bioceramics:**
1. **Material Toxicity:**
   - If the material is toxic, the surrounding tissue experiences deterioration, leading to biomaterials being unsuitable for use.

2. **Biological Inactivity:**
   - Non-toxic materials, like alumina and zirconia, result in the formation of biologically inactive fibrous tissue capsules around the material. This inertness is observable under an optical microscope, showcasing direct opposition of bone to the material.

3. **Bioactive Materials:**
   - Non-toxic, biologically active materials foster the formation of interfacial bonds between the tissue and biomaterials, termed bioactive materials.

4. **Resorbable Biomaterials:**
   - Non-toxic materials that dissolve in surrounding tissue, with the dissolved material being replaced. These are known as resorbable biomaterials.

**Examples of Inert Ceramics:**
- Alumina and zirconia bioceramics exhibit no chemical changes during long-term exposure to physiological environments. In some cases, there may be chemical or mechanical degradation, but the concentration of degradation is controlled by the body's natural regulatory mechanisms.

**Inert Ceramics for Surgical Implants:**
- The first among inert ceramics used for surgical implants is alumina. Alumina, with its high density (99.5 percent), is employed in load-bearing hip and dental applications due to its excellent corrosion resistance, good biocompatibility, high wear resistance, and strength.

**Alumina as an Implant Material:**
- Alumina biomaterials, with a very fine grain size and sintering temperature ranging from 1600 to 1800 degrees Celsius, depend on the properties of raw materials. A small amount of MgO (less than 5 percent) is used as a grain growth inhibitor to achieve a fine grain and high-density sintered body.

- The strength and fracture toughness of alumina are influenced by grain size and sintering material purity. An average grain size of 4 micrometers and purity of 99.7 percent contribute to improved flexural strength and compressive strength. Commercially available alumina biomaterials meet these specifications.

---

**Physical & Mechanical Properties of Alumina as Implant Material:**
- Alumina: 99.7 wt%
- SiO2 + Na2O: <0.02
- Density: 3.98 gm/cc
- Grain Size: 3.4
- Hardness: 2400
- Bending Strength: 595 MPa
- Surface Finish: 0.02 micrometers
- Compressive Strength: 4000 MPa
- Young's Modulus: 380 GPa
- Fracture Toughness: 4 Pa.m^1/2

An increase in grain size decreases fatigue resistance. An average grain size greater than 7 micrometers decreases mechanical properties (currently 3.4 micrometers). High sintered aid helps avoid remaining in the grain boundaries, decreasing fatigue resistance.

The failure of alumina implants within 30 years is less than 200 MPa. Aging and fatigue studies show that alumina ceramics are suitable for younger patients for a longer time.

**Use of Alumina in Total Hip Prosthesis:**
1. Alumina is used in total hip and knee prostheses due to its inertness, good biocompatibility, and high wear resistance.
2. In femoral heads, alumina sockets exhibit less wear and friction compared to other materials.
3. Alumina has been tested in ankle joints, elbows, shoulders, wrists, fingers, and dental implants, showing superior performance to other materials.

---

**Use of Zirconia in Surgical Implants**

While alumina exhibits outstanding bioactivity and wear resistance, it shows moderate flexural strength and toughness. To address this issue, ZrO2 is now commonly used in surgical implants. Zirconia is exceptionally inert in the physiological environment, providing a bio-ceramic advantage over alumina due to its higher fracture toughness, flexural strength, and lower Young's modulus.

Zirconia is considered a promising material for prosthodontics, thanks to its high strength, hardness, excellent wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. However, the development of zirconia bio-ceramics faces uncertainty regarding long-term stability.

Zirconia ceramics, used for surgical implants, come in two types: Teragonal Zirconia stabilized with yttria and Magnesium oxide-stabilized Zirconia. Both types are suitable for load-bearing hip replacements. A drawback is the reduction in strength over time in physiological fluid, wear properties, and potential radioactivity, as testing in simulated body fluid and animals has shown a slight decrease in fracture strength and toughness.

In total joint replacement, the wear and friction wettability of Zirconia ceramics are similar to alumina. The only difference lies in their surface properties, with alumina ceramics having a better surface than zirconia. Wear resistance is evaluated through disc or ring-type tests, indicating that the wear rate of Zirconia/Zirconia coupling is 5000 times that of alumina-alumina coupling in terms of material flexibility and mechanical flexibility.

Zirconia is considered radioactive due to better radiation alpha and gamma, making it suitable for funeral head prostheses. Gamma radiation is not a major concern; however, alpha radiation is used for intended surgical implants because of its high ionization capacity, which can destroy hard and soft tissue. Research is ongoing to check the long-term effects of gamma radiation/emission as an implant material.

**Preparation of Tetragonal Stabilized Zirconia**

Tetragonal stabilized zirconia powder as a bio-ceramic is produced using the sol-gel method, starting with a proper solution and stabilizing it in the tetragonal phase through digestion treatment with 5M NaOH, followed by heat treatment at 700°C (tetragonal stabilized zirconia).

In brief, a 70% propanol solution of zirconium isopropoxide is slowly added drop-wise to a mixture of 135 ml of n-propanol and 8 ml of distilled H2O in a 500 ml round-bottom flask. The suspension is refluxed at 70°C for 12 hours, and the solid formed is dried in an electrical air oven at 105°C overnight.

The hydrous zirconia obtained is ground, sieved, and used for the next procedure concerning various treatments in a basic medium. For digestion (cell repair) treatment in a basic medium, 6 g samples of hydrous zirconia are placed in round-bottom flasks and refluxed at 100°C for 9 hours in the presence of a 60 ml 5M NaOH solution. The obtained solids are filtered, washed, and dried in an oven at 105°C. After drying, some samples are treated with NaOH, heat-treated at 150°C for 2 hours, and then at 700°C for 3 hours in an electric furnace under an air atmosphere to obtain tetragonal stabilized zirconia. The structure of tetragonal stabilized zirconia is investigated by FTIR, XRD, and SEM.
